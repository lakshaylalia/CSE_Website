            NITH faculty come from diverse backgrounds and each individual is a
            sought-after specialist in his or her own area of expertise. Their
            personal experience as entrepreneurs, policy makers, researchers,
            theoreticians and consultants enlivens their teaching and gives it
            immediacy and relevance. Both as educators and researchers, they are
            continually learning. They are well aware that knowledge alone
            changes nothing; the power to affect and shape the future lies with
            the observing, reasoning, creative, curious mind. IIMA faculty make
            a lasting impact on students because they challenge, inspire and
            truly care what happens to their students. Employing the very
            highest standards of teaching and mentoring, they mould students
            into innovators, entrepreneurs and leaders. They are directly
            involved in every aspect of the Institute: teaching, governance and
            research and also work continuously with their industry peers.
            Additionally, some experience in roles outside the academic world
            means that they have a realistic appreciation of the nitty-gritty of
            finance, markets, production, strategy and much more from the
            practice world. From their active involvement, comes the precious
            cross-fertilization of ideas and ensures that IIMA academic
            programmes are not just up to date but oriented to the future.
